            <h2> Greetings!</h2>
            <p> My name is Michael Yuan, and welcome to my personal website. I was born in Plano, Texas on August 7, 1998, and have lived in Texas ever since. </p>
            
            <p>My parents are my inspiration. They immigrated from China to New York for their graduate degrees. My dad attended Cornell University and my mom attended the Rochester Institute of Technology. I have an awesome older sister named Christine and a cute dog named Snowy.</p>
            
            <p>When I was young, I had a curiosity for almost everything in this world. These curiosities ultimately culminated into a passion for math, logic, and technology. When I was young, I snuck into a chess class and went on to play chess for five more years. I participated in different math competitions and loved solving brain teasers. I fell in love with the beauty of logic and math and was amazed by how a manmade language could imitate nature so flawlessly. When I got my first phone, I was addicted to technology and learned more about computer science. I was so intrigued with using technology as a medium to connect with other and to help others by solving problems that were previously unsolvable. </p>
            
            <p>These interests made me want to learn more knowledge about those subjects. I attended the Texas Academy of Math and Science, and used my mathematical and technical abilities in biological research projects with university professors. I am now an Operations Research major and a Computer Science minor. I now attend Cornell University as well, hoping to follow and ultimately overtake my dad's footsteps.</p>
            
            <p>Although I am mostly interested in math and technology, I am fascinated with many other wonders of this world. I'm a sports enthusiast and a giant history and humanities buff. I am a foodie and a Settler of Catan. I aspire to be the quintessential man, and intend to enjoy my journey along the way.</p>
