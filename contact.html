            <h2> Come Say Hi!</h2>
            <p> I am a sophomore at Cornell and am currently studying in Ithaca, New York. During the summer and winter breaks, I am most likely at home in Frisco, Texas. If you want to find me in person, just visit any Taco Bell in those cities and I am 99% there eating a Chalupa Supreme. </p>
            
            <p>If you would like to send me any content (professional content, memes, corgi videos, etc.), send me an e-mail! My e-mail is mty6@cornell.edu. </p>
            
            <p>If you want my digits, talk to me first! I am on all social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Github. My profiles can be found on the footer section of this website. </p>
            
            <p>Thanks for visiting my site! I hope to meet you soon, and have a spectacular day!</p>
